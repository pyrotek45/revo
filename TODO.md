## 1.0 requirements

these must be completed before the language goes public:

- [ ] **predictable type inference and typechecker**
  - needed to optimize bytecode generation (e.g., distinguish `table_get` vs `tuple_get`)
  - needed for zerocost comptime type-checking, like picking the right loop iterator
  - then, make structs comptime and add go's interfaces

- [ ] **comptime test system**
  - normal tests
  ```ruby
  test "test name" do
    assert!(:true)
  end
  ```
  - doctests (like elixir)
  ```ruby
  ## @doc 
  returns @n multiplied by 2 for all positive numbers
  t> double(2)
  (:ok, 4)
  t> double("hi")
  (:err, "arg 0 is not a positive number")
  ##
  fn double(n: number) match n
  | x when x > 0 and number?(x) ok(x*2)
  | _ err("arg 0 is not a positive number")
  ```

- [ ] **repl**
  - live ast checking

- [ ] **decorator system**
  - especially for metamethods
  - `@defer` binding decorator for resource cleanup (maybe not)
    ```asm
    let a @defer(fn(x) x:close()) = io:open("f.txt") 
    ```

- [ ] **macro enhancements**
  - pattern matching for macros
  - importable macros with `use` statement
    - are currently always global

## perf

### advanced io
- [ ] **kqueue** (bsd and osx)
- [ ] **uring** (linux)

## std expansion

### easy

- [ ] **expose zig code as stdlib**
  - language's ast, assembly, lexer, and parser
  - http client/server
  - json parsing and generation
  - simple key-value db with disk i/o
  - regex (wrap system's engine from c or maybe take lua's match)

### lang

- [ ] **bigints** - arbitrary precision arithmetic

- [ ] **language features**
  - `defer` statement (maybe not)
  - better forloops with captures:
    - `for {1,2,3} |el| print(el)`
    - `for {1,2,3}, 0..10 |el, i| print(i, el)`
    - `while i<10 : (i--) print(i)`

- [ ] **zerocost**
  - `mean` keyword (or `btw`, `meanwhile`, `also`) - pure non-functional, executes side-effects and returns nothing
    `1 + mean(12) "hi"  # prints "hi", then returns 1 + 12`
  - `inspect` - print value with line number, return unchanged
     `1 + inspect(2) == 3`

## nice-to-have

### cli

- [ ] **cli polish** - match the quality/aesthetics of bun
  - better error messages
  - progress indicators
  - help text improvements

### build system

- [ ] **built-in build/task system** - similar to bun, deno, or cargo
- [ ] **package resolution and paths** - dependency management
- [ ] **`use` statement** - for importing and binding to scope
  ```asm
  use "json"
  io.parse("{1: 'hi'}")
  ```

## cool but optional

- [ ] **lisp** - parses tree nodes directly how the compiler sees them, looks just like the parser's
    print functionality. not really a lisp in a tradition sense but looks fun to implement
- [ ] rewrite docgen.py in revo (long way to go)
- [ ] **reconstruct syntax from ast**

## done

- [x] distinct single and double quotes
- [x] string escaping with backslash
- [x] for loops
  - [x] numeric for loops
- [x] while loops
- [x] structs (abstractions over tuples)
- [x] compile-time evaluation
  - [x] comptime closures (isolated vms)
  - [x] automatic constant folding
- [x] no nil just atoms
- [x] default metamethods for built-in data types
- [x] go-style channels
- [x] save bytecode to disk
- [x] bytecode compilation flag (`-b`)
- [x] custom bytecode output path (`-o`)

## known issues

### docs

- [ ] document when/where `:nil`, `:undef`, and other special atoms are used
