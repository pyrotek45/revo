**revo** is an expressive, dynamically-typed language that is made\
to balance semantic freedom and readability

# installing
you will need [zig `0.16.0`](https://ziglang.org/download)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/if-not-nil/revo && cd revo
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
cp ./zig-out/bin/revo ~/.local/bin/revo
revo -h
```

binary releases not yet available

# usage

```bash
usage: revo [options] [script [args...]]

options:
  -e code          run code
  -i               enter interactive mode after executing
  -d               output the last value the program evaluated
  -b               compile script to bytecode (.rvo)
  -o path          output path for -b (default: input with .rvo extension)
  --test           run test blocks
  --bench[n]       run with performance counters ([n] iterations, 1 if not specified)
  --dis            show bytecode disassembly instead of running
  -h, --help       show this help message
  --version        show version

examples:
  revo                           start interactive REPL
  revo script.rv                 run script
  revo -e "1 + 2"                run inline code
  revo -e "1 + 2" -i             run inline code and enter REPL
  revo -b script.rv              compile script to bytecode
  revo -b -o output.rvo script   compile script with custom output path
  revo --bench script.rv         run with performance counters
  revo --dis script.rv           show bytecode disassembly
```

## development

### building

```bash
zig build # debug build
zig build run # debug run (repl implementation is hardcoded to a very simple one)
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast # release build
zig build -Drepl=none # custom repl backend (bestline, readline, libedit, none)
# build C library + auto-generated header
# check zig-out/include/, zig-out/lib/
zig build lib 
```

the default repl backend is the vendored bestline, linked statically. read [build.zig](./build.zig)

**note:** the C library and header are only built with `zig build lib`.
the auto-generated header is always in sync with exported functions, marked with `callconv("c")`

### running tests

```bash
zig build test --summary all -Dtest_filter="some test name filter"
```

### contributing

recommending to a friend is always greatly appreciated. any contributions are welcome!

see `TODO.md` for plans

if adding an std function, please add a doc-comment that can get parsed by `scripts/docgen.py`

please do not submit LLM-authored code if you do not understand it,\
can't explain it or have not tested it. describe the request in your own words,\
rather than pulling in a wall of AI-generated text.\
this greatly reduces maintenance burden
